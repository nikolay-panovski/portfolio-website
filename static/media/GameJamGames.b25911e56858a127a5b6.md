In this project, I use the XP Game Jam held at Saxion CMGT during 5-7 April 2024 as an opportunity to refresh my game development skills and aim for a fast-paced environment that forces me out of my usual workflow – fast and dirty instead of slow and analytic. This comes after study work across ~2 years for various company- or societally-useful projects but barely any video game content.

This project contains game jam work on two projects – a team one (directly at the XP Game Jam) and an individual one (simulated at home in ~20 hours). With this, I also practiced on communication and project-based work in fast and effective ways. Reflection documents are also featured (first 2 images in the Gallery).
