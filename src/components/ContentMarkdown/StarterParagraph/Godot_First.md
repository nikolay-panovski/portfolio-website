I chose to do this project in order to test out Godot as an alternative game engine in my arsenal to Unity, and to improve my game design by conceptualizing assets and gameplay mechanics one would likely do in their first experience making a new game.

Among new engine knowledge, I also learned how to model a player character jump to express it via intuitive properties in the Inspector (for example, desired jump distance and height in tiles).
